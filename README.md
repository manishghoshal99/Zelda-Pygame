# Goal üéØ
The goal of the game is to kill many monsters and get EXP to upgrade your skills! If your health runs out, the game will close automatically, so **DON'T DIE!** Goodluck! Also, this code is not a full game, its just a nice project to pass time. It shows how powerful Python really is!

# Controls ‚å®
| Key | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| `Arrow Keys` | Move |
| `Space Bar` | Attack |
| `Left Control` | Magic |
| `Q` | Change Weapon |
| `E` | Change Magic |
| `M` | Toggle Upgrade Menu |

# How to Use Upgrade Menu üîº
You can upgrade your skills using the EXP you get from killing monsters. Each skill has a cost. Navigate the menu with the Left and Right buttons, and press Space to upgrade a skill! After you're done, press M again to exit and continue playing.
