A Zelda-like game I made with Python as the Final Project Submission for Stanford CIP 2023. Other than the amazing course material, I followed this tutorial as well https://youtu.be/QU1pPzEGrqw.

# How to Download and Run ‚¨á
1. Make sure you have Python installed and Pygame too. If you have Python, go to the Command Line and type `pip install pygame`.
2. Download this Repository (You can clone it) or head to the [`releases page`](INPUT GITHUB LINK).
3. Extract the ZIP file and find the `Main.py` file which is located in the `Code` folder.
4. Run this file and enjoy! <br /> 

Also, there is a folder with pictures included to help you with the download process.

# Goal üéØ
The goal of the game is to kill many monsters and get EXP to upgrade your skills! If your health runs out, the game will close automatically, so **DON'T DIE!** Goodluck! Also, this code is not a full game, its just a nice project to pass time. It shows how powerful Python really is!

# Controls ‚å®
| Key | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| `Arrow Keys` | Move |
| `Space Bar` | Attack |
| `Left Control` | Magic |
| `Q` | Change Weapon |
| `E` | Change Magic |
| `M` | Toggle Upgrade Menu |

# How to Use Upgrade Menu üîº
You can upgrade your skills using the EXP you get from killing monsters. Each skill has a cost. Navigate the menu with the Left and Right buttons, and press Space to upgrade a skill! After you're done, press M again to exit and continue playing.

# Magic and Spells ‚ú®
There is two types of spells: Flame and Heal. Flame is a long-range attack. And Heal will heal you... Obviously. Casting a spell will decrease your energy. Energy will recharge over time.

# UI üñ•
**Red Bar:** Health <br />
**Blue Bar:** Energy (Will decrease everytime you use magic and recharges after a while) <br />
**Two Boxes on the Bottom Left:** Weapon and Magic Selection <br />
**Bottom Right Box:** EXP <br />

# Python and Pygame üêç
